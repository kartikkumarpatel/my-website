          <h1>Interests and Hobbies</h1>

          <p className="interests-info">My interests and hobbies vary from operating in the technology industry and operating within teams to being a customer representative and playing sports. I enjoy and have a passion for developing front-end web applications for clients, which suits their needs. This passion further extends my ability to self-learn and understand how new frameworks operate and the impact it can have on a clients web application. My skill set varies from tools to develop websites, progress tracking tools, collaborative code communication tools and modern frameworks. Furthermore, when I have been given the opportunity to lead a team and take charge, I always like to take the opportunity to lead a team to success. 
			<br/><br/>
			My hobbies involve me to get involved in social events within team activities to increase the relationship and communication ways within the teammates. My favorite hobby for me is to maintain a fit and healthy body by playing social or competitive sports and going to the gym.
